# Vision AI Intern Assignment – Solution

This repository contains my solution for the **Vision AI intern assignment** at [Golden Owl](https://goldenowl.asia).
The assignment includes **two exercises**:

1. **Image Classification (Dog vs Cat)**

   * Implemented a binary image classifier using PyTorch.
   * The model can distinguish between **dog** and **cat** images.
   * Includes training script, prediction script, and a FastAPI server for inference.
   * Implemented with:

     * **FastAPI** backend for API serving.
     * **React + Next.js** frontend for user interaction.
   * Details & usage instructions in [`image_classification/README.md`](./image_classification/README.md).

2. **Text-to-Speech (Vietnamese)**

   * Proposed an approach for building a **Vietnamese TTS system**.
   * Described pipeline, algorithms, challenges, and possible improvements.
   * Implemented a working TTS model deployed on **Hugging Face**, with:

     * **FastAPI** backend for API serving.
     * **React + Next.js** frontend for user interaction.
   * Full proposal and implementation details in [`text_to_speech/README.md`](./text_to_speech/README.md).
